# Samey AI Assessment Solution By Pranav Bansode.

## • Problem_1 (Only Explorer Mode) [Problem_1.py]
## Solution Overview

This solution creates an interactive web application combining natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to enhance sentiment analysis and psychological insights from text and audio inputs. The application leverages various NLP libraries and machine learning algorithms to comprehensively analyze emotional states and psychological conditions based on user-provided text or audio data.

## Key Features of this solution

- Sentiment Analysis: Determines the overall sentiment of text input using advanced NLP techniques.
- Psychological State Classification: Identifies psychological states such as joy, anger, confusion, excitement, sadness, anxiety, calmness, and boredom.
- Entity Extraction: Detects named entities in the input text.
- Audio Processing: Transcribes audio files into text and analyzes tempo and pitch characteristics.
- Interactive Visualization: Displays sentiment analysis results in a bar chart.
- User-Friendly Interface: Utilizes Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit: For creating the interactive web interface
- NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and sentiment analysis
- spaCy: Modern natural language understanding library
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms for classification
- TextBlob: Simple API for diving into common NLP tasks
- Librosa: Audio analysis library
- Speech Recognition: For transcribing audio files

## Solution Structure

The project consists of several key components:

1. EnhancedAnalyzer Class: Centralizes all analysis functionality
2. Text Analysis Module: Handles sentiment scoring, subjectivity detection, and psychological state classification
3. Audio Processing Module: Transcribes audio and extracts tempo and pitch features
4. Visualization Module: Creates interactive charts using Plotly
5. Main Application: Manages user input selection and results display

## Implementation Highlights

- Custom Psychological State Classifier: Trains a machine learning model to identify specific emotional states
- Advanced Sentiment Scoring: Uses compound scores for nuanced sentiment analysis
- Entity Extraction: Leverages spaCy's named entity recognition capabilities
- Audio Feature Extraction: Analyzes tempo and pitch characteristics of speech

## Potential Applications

- Mental Health Support Systems
- Customer Service Analytics
- Social Media Monitoring Tools
- Content Creation Assistance

## Future Improvements

- Integration with additional NLP libraries for enhanced feature extraction
- Development of more sophisticated machine learning models for improved accuracy
- Expansion to support multiple languages
- Incorporation of real-time feedback mechanisms

1. Install required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install streamlit nltk spacy scikit-learn textblob librosa speech_recognition plotly
   ```

2. Download necessary NLTK data:
   ```
   python -m nltk.downloader vader_lexicon punkt averaged_perceptron_tagger maxent_ne_chunker words
   ```

3. Load the spaCy English model:
   ```
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   problem_1.py
   ```





## • Problem_2 (SameyRAG.ipynb)

## Solution Overview

This solution combines the strengths of traditional information retrieval systems with advanced language models. Our RAG implementation allows users to query a corpus of documents and receive responses generated by an LLM, augmented with relevant retrieved information.

Key features of this project:

- Supports both dense vector retrieval and BM25-based retrieval methods
- Integrates with Google Generative AI for LLM capabilities
- Implements a modular design for easy customization and experimentation
- Provides a chat interface for user interaction

## How It Works

Our RAG system operates as follows:

1. **Document Loading**: PDF files are loaded and processed using PyPDFLoader and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

2. **Vector Store Creation**: Documents are converted into numerical embeddings using GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings and stored in a FAISS vector store.

3. **Retriever Selection**: Users can choose between dense retrieval and BM25 retrieval methods.

4. **Query Processing**: When a user inputs a query, our system retrieves relevant documents from the chosen vector store.

5. **Response Generation**: The retrieved documents are passed along with the original query to the LLM (Google Generative AI).

6. **Response Formatting**: The final response is formatted according to the prompt template.

## Technical Details

- **Retrieval Methods**: 
  - Dense retrieval uses FAISS for efficient similarity searches.
  - BM25Okapi provides relevance-ranked document retrieval.

- **LLM Integration**: 
  - Utilizes ChatGoogleGenerativeAI for generating responses.
  - Temperature control is implemented for fine-tuning output quality.

- **Modular Design**: 
  - Separate functions for loading documents, creating vector stores, retrievers, and RAG chains.
  - Allows for easy modification and extension of individual components.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[repository-name].git
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment:
   - Navigate to the `python_env` folder
   - Import the `NLP.yml` file to create a dedicated Python environment

3. Configure API keys:
   - Set your Google API key in the `os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]`
   - Add your OpenAI API key in the `common/openAI.env` file

4. Run the main SameyRAG.ipynb file:
   ```
   SameyRAG.ipynb
   ```
   This will start the chat interface where you can interact with the RAG system.


1. Run the main script to start the chat interface.
2. Type your queries or questions.
3. The system will retrieve relevant documents and generate responses based on those documents and your input.
